This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### =====CANVAS=====
Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?  Attendance tracker for fitness instructors from anywhere.  

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
Instructors lack administrative tools for setting up classes, taking attendance, and receiving payments.  Brings fitness to the clients.  

- What is the mission statement?
Helping instructors focus on teaching classes rather than their administrative needs on the go.  Fitness the way you want it!
Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
Be able to create clients and instructors.  Where instructors will be admins and a calendar with class times, location, etc..  Limit students to each workout.  Create different types of classes.  

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
Tracking of attendance for classes/workout measure.


- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
Fitbit, sales.vargaro.com, sweatcoin 
Frameworks - Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
Formik, React, Material, Semantic, Google maps, Fitbit api, 

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
Google maps, and fitbit

- Are you required to pay to use the API?
Google.  

- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
None that would work for this application.

Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
Anybody who has a desire to work out for people who don't want to be tied down to a gym.


- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?  
Amazing idea for those that need a leader/instructor for workouts.


- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?



Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
